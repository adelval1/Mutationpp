Python Bindings for Mutation++.

### Installation

1.  From the `interface/python` root directory, execute the install script:
```bash
python setup.py install 
```
This will compile Mutation++ and install the Python bindings to your Python distribution (using virtualenv or conda is recommended for maximum flexibility and minimum pain).
